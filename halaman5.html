            Special last page, i want you to know what i feel. Since the very first day we met, i never thought that i would choose you again, i just let us being as c-t for a second time. Until i came back to Bandung, and its remind me of you. On the way home, i was hoping that i could talk with you when i got home. And two days later, we talk a lot. We spent a lot time talking on the phone together. Sharing about what happend in our day everyday. You make me laugh, you make me feel happy, you comfort me, you listen all my yapping, especially you make me feel loved.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will always and never bored to say thank you to you. For anything you did to me, for anything that happened between us. You know that time not gonna stuck in one moment right? I don't know what the future holds, but whatever happens, i will be forever grateful that i've been a part of your life. Hope you'll always be my aa. Thank you for told me about the things that i never know before.
        </p>

            If one day we need to leave each other, just so you know that i will always loving you in silence. Bandung's gonna remind me of you everytime i came back there. If we have to go our seperate ways for a while, i just hope we will cross path again someday-somehow. Be happy ya aa..
